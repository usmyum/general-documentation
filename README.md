ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, its Usman again!

# general-documentation
This repository is not code related, rather focuses more on best practices for development lifecycle. 

Documents available on this repository are the mostly daily life conventions & best practices that every developer follows regularly and are easier to find anywhere online. I just thought of compiling them together and have it available in once place.

Also, recently I shared my documents in my current role and they are pretty happy to follow them as the standard which is a decent motivation for me to share with everyone. 

Happy coding devs!
